# Get input from the user

# Get the total width from the user
total_width = int(input("Enter the total width: "))

# Step 3: If total width is less than the string length, print the string as is
# Step 4: Calculate the number of spaces needed on the left and right
# Step 5: Print the string with spaces added to center it
