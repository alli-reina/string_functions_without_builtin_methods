# Program: Count Occurrences in String  

# Get user input as 'text'
text = input("Enter a string: ")    
# Get user input as 'char' (character to count)
char = input("Enter character to count: ")

# Step 3: Set 'count' to 0  
# Step 4: Loop through each character in 'text':  
#         If the character matches 'char', increase 'count' by 1  
# Step 5: Print 'count'
